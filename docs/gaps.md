Needed to create indexes on the firestore database so we can get the history.

The historical downtime calculations were not done - needed to iterate on this.

GPT linked to a non-existent topography file, so I found one and put it in the repo.

The test data was not in the right format, so I had to reformat it.

Various ES/typescript inconsistencies were fixed - particularly with import vs require statements

Improved the CSS to make it look more "Wargames" like.
